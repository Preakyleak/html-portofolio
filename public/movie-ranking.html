<h3>Godfather</h3>
<p>
  Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama,
  based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful
  Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the
  don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he
  becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although
  Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane
  Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.

<h3>Shutter island</h3>
<p>
  The implausible escape of a brilliant murderess brings U.S. Marshal Teddy
  Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner (Mark Ruffalo) to Ashecliffe
  Hospital, a fortress-like insane asylum located on a remote, windswept island.
  The woman appears to have vanished from a locked room, and there are hints of
  terrible deeds committed within the hospital walls. As the investigation
  deepens, Teddy realizes he will have to confront his own dark fears if he
  hopes to make it off the island alive.

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>
  Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a thief with the rare ability to enter
  people's dreams and steal their secrets from their subconscious. His skill has
  made him a hot commodity in the world of corporate espionage but has also cost
  him everything he loves. Cobb gets a chance at redemption when he is offered a
  seemingly impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. If he succeeds, it
  will be the perfect crime, but a dangerous enemy anticipates Cobb's every
  move.
